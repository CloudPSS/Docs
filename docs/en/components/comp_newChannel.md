## Basic Description

{% compsymbol newChannel %}

> **This component implements the acquisition of the signal generated by the simulation and passes it to the `Oscilloscope Group`, analogous to the probe of the actual physical oscilloscope.**

## Parameter

### Configuration

| Parameter name       | Unit | Remark                    |         Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------------------- | :--- | :------------------------ | :------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Channel Name         |      | Name of component         |         Text         | Enter the name of the output channel, which will be displayed in the legend of the simulation results. If not filled, the system default name will be displayed |
| Sampling Frequency   | Hz   | Sampling frequency        | Real number（Const） | Sampling frequency. Higher the frequency，more accurate displayed waveform and longer the simulation time                                                       |
| Dim. of Input Signal |      | Dimension of input signal | Real number（Const） | Dimension of input signal which connects to this output channel                                                                                                 |

## Using Instructions

{% pullquote info %}
In order to display the output of a certain simulation signal, both the "output channel" and "oscilloscope group" components must be added at the same time. The “output channel” realizes the acquisition of the signal generated by the simulation and transmits it to the “oscilloscope group”. Click the “oscilloscope group” to display the “output channel” name and check the corresponding name to be in the “oscilloscope group”. This signal would be displayed in this group. In a simulation project file, the "output channel" and "oscilloscope group" can theoretically exist any number. The user can set the signal selected by the "oscilloscope group" according to the type and size range of the signal to be output, which is convenient for the simulation analysis.
{% endpullquote %}

{% pullquote info %}
The input port of the "output channel" can be the signal name, the pin number and the connecting line (wire and signal line) starting with the \#. When the input port is connected as a wire, the sampling data is the voltage of the wire connection node to the ground.
