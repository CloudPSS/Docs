## Using Instructions

::: info
In order to display the output of a certain simulation signal, both the "output channel" and "oscilloscope group" components must be added at the same time. The “output channel” realizes the acquisition of the signal generated by the simulation and transmits it to the “oscilloscope group”. Click the “oscilloscope group” to display the “output channel” name and check the corresponding name to be in the “oscilloscope group”. This signal would be displayed in this group. In a simulation project file, the "output channel" and "oscilloscope group" can theoretically exist any number. The user can set the signal selected by the "oscilloscope group" according to the type and size range of the signal to be output, which is convenient for the simulation analysis.
